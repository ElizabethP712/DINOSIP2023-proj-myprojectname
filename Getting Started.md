# Getting Started - Installation & General Commands of MambaForge and Terminal

## Step #1: Install MambaForge
The first step I took was installing the package manager, mambaforge, so that I could create an environment, or container for necessary Python packages with the code and functions used throughout the project. Mambaforge is like a shinier, newer version of Conda (short for the manager, Anaconda), so if you already have conda installed you should still be fine. Just make sure to convert initial lines in commands from conda to mamba or vice versa.
